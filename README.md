# Music control bar

- Approx. completion time: **1 hour**
- Deliverables: **1 HTML file, 1 CSS file, images**

**Practice using `position`, `absolute`, and `relative` by recreating a music control bar.**

- Your goal is to match images in the `screenshots` folder.
- The HTML is already done—don’t touch it.
- And some of the CSS is in place too.
- *What’s important for you to do is add the proper `position` and coordinates to the correct elements.*

**Only use these CSS properties:**

- `position`
- `top`, `left`, `right`, `bottom`
- `width`
